_________________________________________________________________

          Topic:    text, text, text (arrays, functions, strings)

          Approach: Build CGI programs, then build the tools they use

          Overview and Intro
                    Basic Operation of Web Communication
                       Connect, Request, Act, Reply
                    Basic parts of a cgi application: form, connector, script, tools

          CGI Example
                    stationnames - no form needed

          Improving Our Website
                    Clearer - use hyperlinks to make access to tools as text
                    Robust - Reduce user error with radio buttons
                    Flexible - Add choices with radio buttons
                    Summary: (1) Hyperlinks, (2) radio buttons, (3) if..then..

          C Data Types and Structures
                    C has only the basic types the machine supports: int, float, char, pointer
                    Only three types of aggregate storage: array, struct, union
                    No data types hide any internal structure

          Array Basics
                    What
                    Operations: Creating, Indexing, Initializing
                    => Note: a multi-dimensional array IS an array of arrays
                    Arrays and Functions: always pass by reference
                    example: array-func-demo.c

          String Basics
                    A string is an array of chars with a '\0' to mark end
                    One works with strings using functions

          String Programming
                    Inherits from array
                    Input/Output has special methods
                    writing splitline
                    using splitline
                    writing readln
                    using readln

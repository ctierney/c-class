Homework 4

1> implement all the functions in the sample programs (wlfiler1.c...) from lecture.

The required functions are implemented in wlfiler6.c

2> word_delete(char str[])

word_delete(str[]) can be found in wlfiler6.c

3> write a new read_word() function that returns a pointer to a word that was read from stdin.

explanation: since scanf() takes a pointer to a char array, it's limited to reading words that can fit into 
the memory that has been allocated to that memory space. I have replaced that method with a function called read_word() which dynamically allocates memory and grows that memory to the size that is required. 

I was a little confused that wlmain.c is also sym-linked from lib113 in my directory after 
performing this command: 

ln -s  Ìƒlib113/hw/wf/files/*  .

..in accordance with the instructions. But, I assume it's okay to overwrite that so that I 
can use my new read_word function.
